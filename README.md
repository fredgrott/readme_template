## Code of Conduct

You cannot joke about something you are not as you will always goof-up on what might be funny for that person thus only joke about yourself instead. If you cannot treat them as you would treat your children, your brothers and sisters, and your parents it may be the wrong action to do towards another person.

And, it goes without saying no racism, sexism, hate of LGBT, hate of creed(and yes atheism is a creed), etc.
